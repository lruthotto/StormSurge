# StormSurge
Welcome! This is the repository for sharing code between Emily, Hannah and Logan for our 2022 Emory REU project.
[These files](https://github.com/hakuupi/StormSurge) contain all the code and data used in our project, along with our [website](https://github.com/loganpknudsen/emory-reu-ret-website/blob/main/content/projects/2022-storm-surge/index.md) (which is not yet online!) discussing our research. [Here](https://www.math.emory.edu/site/cmds-reuret/summer2022/) is the link to the Summer 2022 Emory REU/RET Computational Mathematics for Data Science of which this project was a part of. Further, you can find our Midterm Presentation [here](https://github.com/hakuupi/StormSurge/blob/main/Mid_Term_Presentation.pdf).<br/>
The code used to run model and perform assimilation is [here](https://github.com/hakuupi/StormSurge/tree/main/Juypter_Notebook_Code), we ran Python in Jupyter Notebook to generate data and run model.<br/>
Our data is stored [here](https://github.com/hakuupi/StormSurge/tree/main/Experiment_Data) and is saved in csv files. Note that the parameters and initial conditions used are in the name of the file. <br/>
The MATLAB code used to generate graphics used in our paper is found [here](https://github.com/hakuupi/StormSurge/tree/main/Matlab_Plot_Code).
